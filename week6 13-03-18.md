# Week 6

This week I have been tasked to do the Dependency Description and Detailed Design with Rob.

Rob was doing the Component Diagrams for the Dependency Description so I took the Detailed Design.

The majority of the text has been completed except the significant algorithms part in which I am unsure of the difficulties faced when Wiktor implemented the algorithms.

The overall class diagram is completed and needs separating out into relevant parts. I have started but haven't finished any Object diagrams as the class diagram needs to be separated first. I will have time to do this before the review meeting on Monday.

I have also managed to update the UI by adding css and styling to make it look like the UI screen mockups. I have only managed to do 3 screens so far, the Main Menu, Game Screen and End Screen but I should be able to finish all styling by next week.

I have spent about 6 hours this week on the Design Document.

I have spent about 4 hours this week updating the UI to follow the UI spec.

Total hours: 10
