# Week 2

I missed this weeks main group meeting with Laurence due to being sick with the flu. I also haven't been able to find that much time to do work due to the illness too.

I did manage to make a class for the countdown timer and figure that part out on a separate thread so the timer tick doesn't block other parts of the program being executed.

The UML diagram so far hasn't changed from last week as I am yet to talk to Wiktor about the classes he needs for the UI. The class/method descriptions also hasn't been updated fully yet (This may change for tomorrow's meeting as I have free time to work on it tonight).

I had a look over specific QA documents 2,3 and 8 to familiarise myself with how the gitlab should be setup and for more information on the roles. I put myself forward for deputy project leader in our own group meeting and needed to know the role.

Time spent this week on project: 2 hours 30 mins
