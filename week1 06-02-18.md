# Week 1
This week we got assigned our initial job roles and I am working on the programs architecture with Robert. We discussed briefly in the meeting on Monday about the classes and both came to the same rough conclusion on the classes.

The first 2 classes that were identified were a cube class and a grid class. The grid class should contain some sort of a way of representing the 3x3 grid of characters such as a multidimensional array. The cube class will need 3 of these grids to make the whole 3x3x3 cube.

A countdown timer needs to be included on each cube to track the time remaining for that cube.

There also needs to be a dictionary of searchable words so when the user submits a word, that word can be checked to see if it's a valid word and how many points it scores. This could be put into the UI class to reduce memory load as it should only be loaded once due to being at least 50,000 words which would be a lot to load for every cube. These words could also be put into a database and have a class that accesses the database for checking if the word is valid and have the points scored calculated in this class too.

I also skimmed over some of the QA documentation this week but I need to go over it in more depth before continuing the design.
