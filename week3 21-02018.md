# Week 3

This week Laurence asked us (Rob and myself) to show the group some of the diagrams we were making for the projects overall design. I was working on updating the Class diagram and creating the Statechart diagram and Rob was working on the sequence and component diagram.

The Class diagram that I made is now updated but is still a rough version and will likely change by next week. The Statechart diagram that I was working on this week is mostly finished and needs to be reviewed by the group.

I have also been working on the Timer again so that it has all the methods needed for Wiktor to display the time in the UI.

I have spent a total of about 10 hours this week working on the diagrams/timer/documentation.
