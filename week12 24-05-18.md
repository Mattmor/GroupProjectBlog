# Week 12

This week I was assigned to the maintenance manual (algorithms and things to watch for when making changes). I have completed this work after having it reviewed so that we have a full document for the meeting tomorrow.

I have also spent some time commenting the timer for the project and updating the comments for the methods Wiktor made and I have updated.

This week I have spent 4 hours completing my part of the maintenance manual and 1 hour commenting/recommenting the code which brings the total hours spent this week on the project to 5 hours.
