#Easter/Week 10

Over easter we were told to work on other things rather than the group project. Therefore this is what I did.

I did manage to find some time to finish all the UI pages so that all the buttons are linked, but thats all I managed to do.

I have spent roughly 2 hours over easter working on the UI code for the project.
