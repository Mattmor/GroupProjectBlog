# Week 4

This week I got the timer integrated with the rest of the program which meant changing the class from a thread to a javafx task. I also set up the event listener for each tick in the Game Engine so both threads can communicate with each-other.

I also started on a task-list so that everyone knows the tasks that need doing and when they need completing by. This should help the group track the progress of the project and will be useful when assigning tasks.

I have also only just started on styling the UI. This should be more fleshed out by next week as that is what I will be working on.

I have worked on the project for about a total of 5 hours this week.
