# Week 14

This week includes everything from Wednesday of work week onwards.

On Wednesday, I was updating the UI to look more like the UI document design. The group got together and discussed the pictures, colours and layout of the current program and this resulted in many planned changes. I then went away and completed many of these changes. It took 7 hours total for the meeting and changes on Wednesday.

On Thursday, we were playing the game and looking for bugs. I was therefore fixing all of the bugs that were being found and adding a dark mode style sheet. Bug fixing took a while and I was working long into the night to fix the problems so I worked on this for roughly 12 hours.

Friday at 4pm was the deadline for any code changes so I was up early fixing more bugs. We met up at 11am until 4pm to work on finding and fixing any last bugs in the program. I spent 5 hours with the group and an additional 3 hours before the meeting fixing bugs. The total for Friday was 8 hours.

On Monday I spent some time going through the design document, making sure the design document classes were up to date with the current code and putting more detail into explaining how the program should work. I spent 3 hours doing this on Monday.

On Tuesday I spent the morning making the extra sequence diagrams that was needed for the design document. The group met at 2pm to 4pm to discuss the documents and anything else that needed amending with them. I spent 2 hours in the meeting and 5 hours before the meeting making sure everything in the design document was up to date. This makes Tuesdays total 7 hours.

In total I spent 37 hours this week working on code/documentation.
