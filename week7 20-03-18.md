# Week 7

This week I was tasked to complete the detailed design for the design Document. This included the sequence diagrams, class diagrams and object diagrams.

I first made an overall class diagram which I could split into relevant parts while explaining the data structures. I then explained the major structures in the program and cropped the diagram to explain this better.

I also was tasked to write about any major algorithms and any issues that have occurred when implementing them. There were almost no issues implementing any of the algorithms and therefore I couldn't write much about them.

I also made a couple of sequence diagrams to explain specific parts of the program. I believe I will need to make a few more to explain parts such as loading, saving and changing state in the program and will get on these next week ready to add after feedback is given.

I have spent roughly 12 hours this week working on the design document and related diagrams.
