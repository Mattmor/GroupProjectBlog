# Week 13

This week was the start of work week. As Bronte was away for 2 days I was stand-in group leader.

On Monday, I took group through a full review of the documents. We all read through all of the documents and gave feedback. The documents with written feedback will be given out to individual group members to complete. I will be doing the design document feedback.

On Tuesday, the group played the game fully a few times to get a feel for it and find bugs and quirks that the testing hasn't picked up. Wiktor and I were tasked to fix these bugs with Wiktor doing mostly back-end logic bugs and me doing front-end UI bugs.

I have spent roughly 5 hours this week reviewing the documents and annotating them.
I have also spent roughly 7 hours this week fixing bugs and implementing UI changes.
Total hours this week: 11
