# Week 5

This week I have been working on the diagrams, looking into specific algorithms for optimising the program and some styling for the UI.

I have spent roughly 2 hours on the UI this week however at my current progress, what I have breaks the build and I haven't had enough time to fix it yet.

I have spent roughly 2 hours on looking at the current code and looking into making tthe specific algorithms more efficient.

I have also spent roughly 1 hour on updating the class diagram.

This makes 5 hours in total time spent on the group project. I will have more time to spend on it next week when other assignments aren't due.
